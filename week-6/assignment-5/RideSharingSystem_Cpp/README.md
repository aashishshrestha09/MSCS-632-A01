# Ride Sharing System in C++

## Overview

This project implements a Ride Sharing System in C++ demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

The system models a ride-sharing service with rides of different types, drivers, and riders.

## Project Structure

```makefile
.
â”œâ”€â”€ include                 # Header files for all classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Driver.h
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PremiumRide.h
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Ride.h
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Rider.h
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ StandardRide.h
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp                # Main entry point to run the system
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ run.sh                  # Shell script to build and run the program
â””â”€â”€ src                     # Source files for class implementations
    â”œâ”€â”€ Driver.cpp
    â”œâ”€â”€ PremiumRide.cpp

## Features

- **Ride Class (Base Class)**: Contains basic ride information and methods for fare calculation and displaying ride details.
- **StandardRide & PremiumRide (Derived Classes)**: Override fare calculation to reflect different pricing models.
- **Driver Class**: Holds driver details and list of assigned rides, with proper encapsulation.
- **Rider Class**: Holds rider details and list of requested rides.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrated by storing multiple ride types in a single collection and invoking overridden methods.

## How to Build and Run

## Using the shell script (recommended)

- Make sure you have g++ installed (supports C++11 or later).
- Run the shell script to build and execute the program:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

## Manually via terminal

Compile the program with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude -o RideSharingSystem main.cpp src/Ride.cpp src/Driver.cpp src/StandardRide.cpp src/PremiumRide.cpp src/Rider.cpp
```

Run the program:

```bash
./RideSharingSystem
```
