# Ride Sharing System â€” GNU Smalltalk

A simple ride-sharing system implemented in **GNU Smalltalk 3.2.5**, demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

## Features

- **Ride** base class with subclasses:
  - `StandardRide`
  - `PremiumRide`
- **Driver** class to manage assigned rides.
- **Rider** class to request rides.
- Polymorphic `fare` and `rideDetails` methods.
- Demonstration block creating and linking objects.

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation**:  
  Attributes like `assignedRides` and `requestedRides` are protected and accessed via specific methods.

- **Inheritance**:  
  `StandardRide` and `PremiumRide` inherit from the `Ride` base class.

- **Polymorphism**:  
  Each ride subclass overrides the `fare` method, and a shared interface (`rideDetails`) invokes subclass-specific behavior.

- On macOS

  You can easily install GNU Smalltalk using Homebrew:

  ```
  brew install gnu-smalltalk
  ```

- On Other Platforms

  Check your systemâ€™s package manager or build from source:

  - Official site: https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/

- Or use an online Smalltalk compiler

### Run the Script

```bash
gst RideSharingSystem.st
```
